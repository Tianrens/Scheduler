####AGENDA
- SUBMIT MILESTONE 1
    - merge the branch into it + release with the release note
- Get started on the planning:
    - Multi-threading
    - Data structures & implementation
    - Heuristics - David said that we can just get started with a really simple one for now, use dependency injection so we can switch out later on
    - We need someone to focus on tests to check if a schedule is indeed valid.
- Class diagrams complete
    - Research on visualisation, parallelisation, AO/ELS model
- Timelining
- Task breakdown -> turn into issues


**Final additions before submission**
