##Meeting 5
04/08/2020

####Agenda
- Make sure everyone is on the repo
- Set up project in repo
- Gradle vs Maven
- Decide our timeline and when we want things to be done by - Gantt Chart
- Break down our tasks even more (take the tasks from the WBS)? So we can create issues and link onto the Github Project
- Assign tasks
- Issues and projects?
- Further code conventions
- Architecture

*We decided on Gradle for our project*

*Each milestone of the project needs to be packed in a jar package so that it can be invoked from the command line with the following parameters*

**Decision between algorithms**

1. DFS -- easier to do. Slower but takes less memory
2. A* -- faster but takes HEAPS of memory
