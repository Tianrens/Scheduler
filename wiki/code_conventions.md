# Code Conventions

## Git
- Branch naming: pascalcase
- Use [emoticons](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a?fbclid=IwAR1WS82-f1_IxvhM8HtF1gvlF0lCIi6ryhXnUcVK_e3r6UhCpNs1wowL6Vg) in your commits to categorise changes
- Don’t work on master
- Make Pull Requests for your branches so others can code review before you merge on the master
- git pull origin master [on your branch] to update

## Variable Names
- Underscore for private variables/fields

## Conditional statements
- Keep brackets even if single line conditional statement bodies. Keep line breaks as well.
```
if (condition) {
    //Code
}
```

## Interfaces
- So we don’t have to comment out things
