## A* Algorithm
The Branch and Bound algorithm selected by our team was the A* algorithm. This algorithm is similar to Djikstra's algorithm in that each iteration, all reachable nodes are scanned to find the optimal solution.
However, the unique feature of this algorithm is its use of [heuristics](heuristics.md) to narrow down the search space such that only the algorithm attempts to only branch towards the optimal schedule.
